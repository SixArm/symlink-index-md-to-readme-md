# symlink-index-md-to-readme-md

Symlink each index.md file to its corresponding README.md file.

This tool is typically useful for systems that display the files differently:

  * A typical webserver directory will display the file "index.md" by default.

  * A typical GitHub website page will display the file "README.md" by default.

This tool helps the project developer be compatibile with both ways:

  * The tool uses the file "index.md" as the source of truth.

  * The tool creates (or recreates) the symlink "README.md".
